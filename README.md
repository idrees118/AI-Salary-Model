 AI Job Salary & Role Prediction – Project Summary
📁 Dataset
Filename: ai_job_dataset.csv

Samples: 15,000 rows

Features: 19 columns

Language: Python

🎯 Objectives
Predict AI job salaries based on features

Classify job types (e.g. remote/hybrid/on-site)

Analyze job requirements using NLP

🔄 Step-by-Step Workflow Overview
✅ STEP 1 – Dataset Overview & Cleaning
Successfully loaded a clean dataset with 15,000 rows and 19 columns.

No missing values detected.

Converted posting_date and application_deadline to datetime format.

Normalized all categorical fields (lowercase + whitespace stripping).

🔧 STEP 2 – Feature Preparation
Dropped irrelevant fields such as job_id, company_name, posting_date.

Encoded categorical columns using LabelEncoder.

Target variable selected: salary_usd

Final shape for modeling:

Feature matrix (X): 14 columns

Target vector (y): salary_usd

📊 STEP 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Created powerful visualizations to identify patterns and trends:

Salary Distribution (histogram)

Salary comparison by:

Experience level

Employment type

Remote ratio

Company size

Top 10 most frequent industries

🔍 Key Insights:
Executives earn significantly more than juniors.

Remote roles have broader salary ranges.

Large companies offer higher average salaries than small ones.

🛠️ STEP 4 – Feature Engineering
All categorical features encoded numerically.

Used StandardScaler for feature normalization.

Prepared datasets for machine learning (X, y split).

📈 STEP 5 – Salary Prediction Using Regression
Trained 3 different models to predict salary_usd:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

🔚 Conclusion:
✅ XGBoost is the most accurate model for salary prediction in this dataset.

📉 STEP 6 – Visual Model Comparison
Plotted model performance metrics:

R² Score

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Result:
📌 XGBoost clearly outperformed both Linear Regression and Random Forest in all metrics.

🏷️ STEP 7 – Classification: Predicting Remote Work Type
Target: remote_ratio
(0 = On-site, 50 = Hybrid, 100 = Remote)

Models Used:
Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Result:
❌ Both models only achieved ~33% accuracy.
📌 Indicates current features are not strong predictors for remote status.

🧾 STEP 8 – NLP Analysis of required_skills
Tokenized skills using CountVectorizer (split by comma).

Counted and visualized the top 20 most frequent skills.

🔝 Top Skills Identified:
Python, SQL, TensorFlow, Docker, AWS, Linux, Kubernetes, NLP
